#### Omar Brandon, Ryan Kaplan, Paula McCree-Bailey, and Rohitha Sanka

## Objective
The project should focus on a problem involving the analysis of one or more data sets and the application of machine learning and data mining methods to better inform policing and crime prevention efforts and policies. Building models that can identify patterns in the community crime dataset to help organizations better understand community factors and crimes and give them an advantage when making decisions in their fight against crime, better policing and safer communities. 

## Introduction
Every 31 seconds a car is stolen in the United States, which equates to more than 1 million annually (Straughan, 2024). Data published by the FBI unveils that motor vehicle theft (MVT) is one of the most common crimes in the US but one of the least researched topics (Suresh and Tewksbury 2012). The loss of an automobile can pose significant financial and emotional distress on individuals which results in a disrupted lifestyle pattern. The social disorganization theory, introduced by Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay, aligns closely with our topic of auto theft. This theory emphasizes how environmental factors influence delinquency and criminal behavior (Mendez, Spencer, & Stith, 2019). 

Exploring the relationship between auto theft and social disorganization we see the motivation behind car thieves is emphasized. It was found that many thefts operate on a risk-versus-reward basis. Essentially feeding the concept of an easy to steal vehicle with a higher market value becoming a target (EloGPS 2023). Other factors such as theft for profit, theft to secure transportation, also known as joyriding, were identified as frequent motives committed by adolescents or young adults (Suresh and Tewksbury 2012).

Throughout this research paper and the technical models built, our study identifies how higher vacant housing rates correlate to auto theft crime rates. The goal of this study targets the main question, how does the presence of vacant housing contribute to an increase in auto theft rates in neighborhoods, and to what extent can social disorganization theory be used to predict this relationship? To accomplish this, the psychology of why and how auto theft occurs is examined, along with the influence of high housing vacancy rates, aiming to bring a solution by emphasizing security measures within a neighborhood. While addressing socio economic challenges and encouraging urban planning, community engagement, and improved law enforcement strategies, the problem can be effectively mitigated. Furthermore, the research and result of the combination of literature and machine learning models emphasizes techniques and prevention of auto theft.

## Background
According to Shaw and McKay's work, neighborhoods characterized by weak social cohesion, poor community organization, and high levels of social disorganization are more prone to elevated crime rates, including auto theft. Their pioneering research linked juvenile delinquency and broader criminal behavior to the breakdown of neighborhood social structures. Specifically, the absence of stabilizing institutions, such as strong religious organizations, high-quality schools, and enriching after-school activities, diminishes informal social controls and allows criminal behavior to thrive. This foundational framework helps systematically examine the social and environmental factors that lead to auto theft.

Subsequent studies have validated the relevance of social disorganization theory in explaining modern crime patterns. (Sampson and Groves 1989) expanded this framework, demonstrating that communities marked by low socioeconomic status and family disruption are more likely to experience property crimes, including auto theft. Similarly (Lee et al., 2016) reinforced these findings, illustrating how racial heterogeneity, residential instability, and weakened social ties exacerbate the risk of crime by dismantling the social cohesion necessary to maintain order. Their research emphasized that weakened social ties and disrupted family structures directly undermine collective efficacy, leaving neighborhoods vulnerable to criminal activity. Despite these advances, gaps remain in fully understanding the interplay between socio-economic dynamics and emerging challenges like urban gentrification, technological changes, and variations in housing policies. These areas warrant deeper exploration.

The integration of social disorganization theory into this study reinforces its strength as a guiding framework. It offers an evidence-based foundation for interpreting the relationships between socio-economic factors such as poverty, unemployment, housing vacancy, and auto theft rates. By addressing these structural issues, we aim to identify actionable insights that can inform community-level interventions and policies. Examples of these strategies include neighborhood watch programs that aim to foster community cohesion and collective efficacy, which has been shown to reduce crime. Research by (Bennett, Holloway & Farring, 2006) suggests that active neighborhood watch programs can lead to a reduction in property crimes, including auto theft, as they increase surveillance and informal social control in the community. However, the effectiveness of such programs can vary, particularly in socially fragmented areas, highlighting the importance of tailored approaches.

## Data
The Communities and Crime dataset contains 2,215 observations and 147 features which combined socio-economic data from the 1990 U.S. census, law enforcement data from the 1990 U.S. Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey and the 1995 FBI Uniform Crime Report (UCR) crime data. The range of features include percentage of urban, median income, race per capita, percentage population under poverty, marital status, information on police officers in the community and various types of criminal offenses, provide a lot of information for algorithm predictions. 

### Pre-Processing 
The dataset required significant pre-processing to prepare it for analysis, particularly in terms of handling missing values. Some of the features contained missing values, which were represented by the symbol "?". Rather than attempting to impute missing data, which could introduce bias or reduce the integrity of our analysis, we opted to remove all rows containing missing values. 
```
autoCrime =  autoCrime.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')
autoCrime = autoCrime.replace('?', float('nan'))
autoCrime = autoCrime.dropna()
```
After this entire process, our dataset was left with 2,212 observations and 20 features that we would be looking at. This decision ensured that the remaining dataset was complete and that our analysis could be conducted without concerns about incomplete data.

### Feature Selection
To gain further insight, a heatmap was created to illustrate the strength and direction to the relationships between the features and the target variable. Overall, most of the correlations are nearly zero, which suggests that there is no meaningful relationship between these two variables. For clarity, the number of features shown in the results (Figure 2) was reduced to thirteen, revealing several noteworthy correlations. The heatmap shows the strongest positive correlation of 0.90 between auto theft and house vacancy, suggesting that as house vacancies increase, the number of auto thefts also rises. Additionally, there is a moderate positive correlation of 0.34 between public transportation and auto theft. Other relationships include Auto Theft and Percentage Boarded Vacant houses with 0.18 correlation , Auto Theft and Percentage Unemployed with 0.12 correlation, and Auto theft and Percent Poverty with 0.11 correlation. All these correlations are positive, suggesting that as one feature increases, the other is expected to increase as well.

We dropped features that were not relevant to the research focus, simplifying the dataset to only include socio-economic factors that could potentially influence auto theft rates.
## Model Selection
### Baseline 
The baseline models under consideration include Multiple Linear Regression for continuous target variables, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosted Predictive Models. Cross-validation was applied to each model to improve the reliability of the modelâ€™s performance. For all five models, the best performance was observed when k = 10. With 10-fold cross-validation, each fold is using 90% of the data for training and 10% for testing, providing a better training process compared to 80% training set used in 5-fold cross-validation. Additionally, a larger number of folds reduces the variance in the model. The findings for this process are summarized in Table 2.
